# mdc101
MDC Web Codelabs Adapted for React with Hooks/TypeScript/CRA
## Motivation
This is a 5-part series of the MDC codelabs starting with [MDC101](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-web/) 
I'll initialize the project with **npx create-react-app . --typescript** (CRA) 
Then I'll try to make the tutorials both with and without SASS. I'm not sure, if SASS can be used with a CRA project. SASS is the recommended way of [using MDC Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#using-mdc-web-with-sass-and-es2015)
